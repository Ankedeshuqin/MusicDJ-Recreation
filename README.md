# MusicDJ Recreation

This is a Windows recreation of the **MusicDJ** app found on old Sony Ericsson phones.

You can create melodies, open created melodies, save melodies, play melodies, and anything else you can do on the original MusicDJ app. You can save the melody as either Sony Ericsson MusicDJ MIDI file, or as standard MIDI file.

MIDI data of the blocks are taken from MIDI files created with the original MusicDJ app.

Enjoy!
